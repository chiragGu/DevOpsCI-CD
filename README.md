1) In this upload your code and the test code onto this repository, it is adviced that you put your code and test code in diferent folders on github so that they can be published later.
2) Open Travis CI on Github, Install the free open source one onto this specific repository.
3) Write a .travis.yml which contains all the dependencies, check out the file for further information.
